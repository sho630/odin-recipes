    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
      <p><h3>We’re going back to basics this summer, so let’s talk about avocado toast! Creamy avocado spread onto well-toasted bread is one of my favorite 
          quick meals. Actually, it’s one of my favorite meals in general. It’s so delicious, I’d call it one of life’s simplest pleasures.</h3></p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 slice of bread (I like thick-sliced whole-grain bread best)</li>
        <li>½ ripe avocado</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>      
      </ul>
      <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Toast your slice of bread until golden and firm</li>
          <li>Remove the pit from your avocado. Use a big spoon to scoop out the flesh. Put it in a bowl and mash it up with a fork until it’s as smooth as 
              you like it. Mix in a pinch of salt (about ⅛ teaspoon) and add more to taste, if desired.</li>
          <li>Spread avocado on top of your toast. Enjoy as-is or top with any extras offered in this post (I highly recommend a light sprinkle of flaky 
              sea salt, if you have it).</li>
        </ol>

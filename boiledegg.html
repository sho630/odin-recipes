    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
      <p><h3>I love hard boiled eggs. They're great for deviled eggs, egg salad, or just eating plain with a sprinkle of salt. </h3></p>
      <p><h3>Used to be that people were scared of eating eggs because of the cholesterol in the egg yolks. Not only has research found that 
          eggs also raise the good cholesterol that bodies need, but the latest Federal dietary guidelines no longer warn against dietary 
          cholesterol which made people limit the eggs in their diet in the first place. </h3></p>
      <p><h3>When it comes to boiling eggs, the biggest problem is that people can easily over-cook them, leading to a dark green color 
          around the yolk, and a somewhat sulphuric taste. Here's my method for how to cook hard boiled eggs so that they don't get over-cooked. </h3></p>
      <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
      <ul>
        <li>As many eggs as you need</li>    
      </ul>
      <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Cover the eggs in a saucepan with water </li>
          <li>Heat the pot on high heat and bring the water to a full rolling boil</li>
          <li> Turn off the heat, keep the pan on the hot burner, cover, and let sit for 10-12 minutes</li>   
          <li> Strain the water from the pan and run cold water over the eggs to cool them quickly and stop them from cooking further</li>   
        </ol>
